Fibonacci Sequence is defined as : 1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34.... 
There is an intresting pattern in the series which is that even numbers occur after every two odd numbers.
Consider first few even numbers: 
f : 2,8,34,144,610 ....

	8 = 2*4 + 0
	34 = 8*4 + 2
	144 = 34*4 + 8
	610 = 144*4 + 34

It can be observed that every ith even fib number can be expressed as,
	f(i) = f(i-1)*4 + f(i-2)
