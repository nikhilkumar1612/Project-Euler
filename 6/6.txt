This question is relatively simple than other questions. We make use of the formulae,
	i. Sum of first n natural numbers is given by,
			1+2+3+4+.....+n = (n*(n+1))/2
   ii. Sum of squares of first n natural numbers is given by,
   			1+4+9+16+.....+n*n = (n*(n+1)*(2*n+1))/6
Time complexity : O(1).
Space complexity : O(1).
